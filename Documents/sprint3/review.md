RCOMP 2020-2021 Project - Sprint 3 review
=========================================
### Sprint master: 1191596 ###

# 1. Sprint's backlog #

This sprint focus on changing static routers to based dynamic routing (OSPF). Using DHCPv4 service, VoIP service, HTTP service, configuring DNS servers to establish a DNS domains tree, enforcing NAT and establishing traffic access policies on routers.

# 2. Subtasks assessment #

## 3.1. 1191240 - Update the campus.pkt layer three Packet Tracer simulation from the previous sprint, to include the described features in this sprint for building 1. ###
### Totally implemented with issues. ###

This work was not one of the best, since I had a hard time doing some points of the job, like the ACLs. I also had a great difficulty in the implementation of dynamic routing.


## 3.2. 1190827 - Update the campus.pkt layer three Packet Tracer simulation from the previous sprint, to include the described features in this sprint for building 2. Final integration of each memberâ€™s Packet Tracer simulation into a single simulation. ###
### Totally implemented with issues. ###

Server HTML doesn't open. I also had difficulty in the implementation of dynamic routing.


## 2.3. 1191596 - Update the campus.pkt layer three Packet Tracer simulation from the previous sprint, to include the described features in this sprint for building 3.#
### Partially implemented with issues. ###
Some parts of the sprint weren't tested. I had difficulties configurating the DNS clients (end-nodes).
