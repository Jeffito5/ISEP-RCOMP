RCOMP 2020-2021 Project - Sprint 3 review
=========================================
### Sprint master: 1191596 ###

# 1. Sprint's backlog #

This sprint focus on data transaction between applications using TCP protocol.

# 2. Subtasks assessment #

## 4. 1191240 - Implement communications with the Distribution Center. ###
Many difficulties in implementation because the work had a huge discrepancy in terms of difficulty. Still, what hurt the most was the lack of time due to overwork in a short period of time. We are not sure of almost anything at work because the contents to study have not been consolidated.

## 2. 1190827 - Implement communications with the Host applications. Manage the list of hosts and always there is a file to upload, proceed with sending it. ###
