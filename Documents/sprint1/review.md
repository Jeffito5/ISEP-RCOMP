=========================================
### Sprint master: 1190827 ###

# 1. Sprint's backlog #
In this Sprint, the structured cabling project is to embrace an industrial private closed area with five buildings with two floors each. Our group is made up of only 3 elements so we did the sprint for buildings 1, 2 and 3.

# Task 1.1- Development of a structured cabling project for building 1, and also encompassing the campus backbone. #

* Building 1 will house the data center and the main cross-connection for the structured cabling system. It has horizontal dimensions of, approximately, 40 x 20 meters.

# Task 1.2- Development of a structured cabling project for building 2. #

* Building 2 is intended for administrative services and offices, with horizontal dimensions of, approximately, 60 x 20 meters.

# Task 1.3-Development of a structured cabling project for building 3. #

* Buildings 3 has the left area divided into rooms on both floors, while the right area is a single room with the height of the two floors on the left. All have horizontal dimensions of, approximately, 80 x 30 meters.

All buildings have two floors with wireless LAN coverage (Wi-Fi).

## GROUP ##

During the sprint there were doubts about a lot of things due to the amount of information we had to collect. The rules for placing outlets and cross-connections were followed, but doubts arose where to place them. The material to choose was also one of the difficulties that the group had. Even so, the number of Consolidation Points, patch panels, switches and enclosures also raised questions from all members. However, the group is pleased with the final work and assumes communication between everyone and the teachers as the key factor that mitigated the difficulties.
