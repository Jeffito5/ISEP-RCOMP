RCOMP 2019-2020 Project - Sprint 1 planning
===========================================
### Sprint master: 1190827 ###

# 1. Sprint's backlog #
In this Sprint, the structured cabling project is to embrace an industrial private closed are1with five buildings with two floors each. Our group is made up of only 3 elements so we did the sprint for buildings 1, 2 and 3.

# Task 1.1- Development of 1structured cabling project for building 1, and also encompassing the campus backbone. #

* Building 1 will house the datacenter and the main cross-connection for the structured cabling system. It has horizontal dimensions of, approximately, 40 x 20 meters.

# Task 1.2- Development of 1structured cabling project for building 2. #

* Building 2 is intended for administrative services and offices, with horizontal dimensions of, approximately, 60 x 20 meters.

# Task 1.3-Development of 1structured cabling project for building 3. #

* Buildings 3 has the left area divided into rooms on both floors, while the right area is a single room with the height of the two floors on the left. All have horizontal dimensions of, approximately, 80 x 30 meters.

All buildings have two floors with wireless LAN coverage (Wi-Fi).

# 2. Technical decisions and coordination #

  * Optical fiber cables used: monomode;
  * Copper cables used: CAT7 e CAT6A;
  * Copper patch panels used: CAT7 e CAT6A;
  * Having more Access Points to increase the signal strength on each floor of the buildings;
  * In the images, each fiber cable corresponds to 2 in order to respect the load balancing and failover;

# 3. Subtasks assignment #

  * 1191240 - Structured cable design for building 1, floors 0 and 1;
            - Cable desing of fiber cables supporting all buildings;
            - Wireless coverage design for building 1.
  * 1190827 - Structured cable design for building 2, floors 0 and 1;
            - Wireless coverage design for building 2.
  * 1191596 - Structured cable design for building 3, floors 0 and 1;
            - Wireless coverage design for building 3.
